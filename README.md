# practice-log-calculator

This is my first large-scale project as a part of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. It is intended for use by musicians, 
specifically students, who need a little more structure in their practice routine. The page features two main parts:
the form to fill out, asking about time commitments and pieces to be practiced that day, and the chart, which takes
that information and fills out a chart with the category and name of each piece to be practiced, calculates the time
to be spent on each piece, and is followed by a table row that allows the student to check different skills to be practiced
for each piece, indicated by a check mark. There is a "randomize order" option that allows the pieces to be displayed in a 
random order each time it is pressed, which is a type of practice known as "interleaved practicing," which has many 
proven benefits for skill-building and retention of information. Finally, there is a simple notes section at the bottom
so that the student can verbalize progress made that day, issues, questions for the teacher, or anything else that may
be relevant. There is also a print button available at the top of the chart so that the student can easily document and 
print their progress each week, and bring it to the teacher as proof of practicing, for example.

I chose to use only vanilla Javascript in this project, though at this point in my learning process, I would like to start
learning and implementing jQuery so as to shorten and simplify the process. Moving on in the challenge, I will be using
jQuery as I become more familiar with it.
